In most cases, breaching our rules will result in a temporary suspension but if they're continuously being violated, we will have no choice but to terminate your account. If you believe the suspension or termination has been made in error, you can always contact us by email and we can further investigate the reason behind your suspension or termination. You'll also have the opportunity to ask us to provide some evidence & show you the reason(s) for your account suspension/termination. If we're unable to provide any evidence, your account will be immediately re-instated. If your account gets temporarily suspended, you will need to prove to us that you have read and understood our Terms of Use statement. Until then, your account will remain suspended. We also keep track of each user's violations and suspensions and if your account reaches a certain threshold, it will result in a permanent termination of your account. If you wish to help Fairtalk sustain its healthy community and give every user the best possible experience, we recommend that you report/flag any content that breached our user engagement rules. Reported content will be picked up by our moderators and if the content has indeed breached any of our rules, it will be removed from our platform.
